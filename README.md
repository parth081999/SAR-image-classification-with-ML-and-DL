# SAR-image-classification-with-ML-and-DL

ABSTRACT/ Outline
This project is about the SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar) image segmentation. This project is carried out by using Machine learning and Deep learning
technique. We have used the inception V3 model for training on the dataset. We have achieved the accuracy of 80% by using inception V3 model and 95% by using the ResNet50 model.
This code can be used for image segmentation and classification of various images which are taken from the satellites
